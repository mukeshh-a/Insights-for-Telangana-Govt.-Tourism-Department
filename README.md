# Insights-for-Telangana-Govt.-Tourism-Department

This project is focused on analyzing the tourism data of Telangana from 2016 to 2019 and providing data-driven recommendations to the government to improve the state's revenue and administrative operations. 

The data included information on domestic and foreign visitors to various districts of Telangana.

## Data Sources:

The primary data source for this analysis was the Telangana tourism department. 

However, additional research was conducted to gather information on the population of each district using the official websites of Telangana and India Census. 

Crime rate rankings were obtained from Numbeo, and Swachh Survekshan rankings were obtained from the official websites of Swachh Bharat Mission and Sarkari List.

## Insights:

1. Hyderabad has the highest number of domestic visitors, followed by Rajanna Sircilla and Warangal (Urban).

2. Hyderabad, Rajanna Sircilla, and Warangal (Urban) have the highest Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR).

3. Peak season months for Hyderabad are June, December, and October, while February, March, and September are the low season months.

4. Adilabad, Nizamabad, and Mahbubnagar have a high domestic to foreign tourist ratio.

5. Hyderabad, Jayashankar Bhoopalpally, Yadadri Bhongir, Warangal (Urban), and Rajanna Sircilla have a high population to tourist footfall ratio.

6. Based on the growth rate from previous years, Hyderabad should have 591,726,907 overall visitors, with 513,716,211 domestic visitors and 1,361,753 foreign visitors.

7. According to the average spend of these visitors, the revenue should be around 2,878,444,886,193 rupees, with 2,876,810,782,923 rupees coming from domestic visitors and 1,634,103,270 rupees coming from foreign visitors.

## Recommendations:

1. Diversify tourism offerings: Hyderabad should not rely solely on its historical landmarks and cultural events to attract visitors. The government should promote other aspects of the city such as its cuisine, nightlife, and shopping to appeal to a wider range of tourists.

2. Enhance safety and security measures: Despite the relatively low crime rate, it is still important to prioritize safety and security for tourists. The government should increase police presence and surveillance in high-traffic tourist areas.

3. Promote eco-tourism: Telangana has a rich biodiversity, and the government should capitalize on it by promoting eco-tourism. This can include developing national parks and wildlife sanctuaries, and promoting sustainable tourism practices.

4. Increase awareness of hygiene and cleanliness: While Hyderabad has improved in the Swachh Survekshan rankings, it still has room for improvement. The government should promote cleanliness and hygiene among locals and tourists alike to maintain a good reputation and attract more visitors.

5. Improve infrastructure: The government should invest in improving infrastructure such as roads, public transportation, and accommodations to enhance the overall visitor experience. This will make it easier for tourists to navigate the city and access its attractions.

By implementing these recommendations, Telangana can enhance its tourism industry, attract more visitors, and generate increased revenue.

## Conclusion:

Overall, this project provides valuable insights and data-driven recommendations to the Telangana government to improve tourism revenue and administrative operations. 

The findings and recommendations can be used to develop policies and strategies that can attract more tourists to the state and generate more revenue.
